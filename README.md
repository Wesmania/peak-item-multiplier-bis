# ItemMultiplierBis

A mod that allows you to change the amount of items spawning in luggages, on vines, on bushes and on the ground.

A replacement for the "Item Multiplier" mod, fixing the issue of the grab hook not being spawned properly.

## Features

* You can specify an item multiplier, which will multiply the amount of stuff spawned by that amount.
* You can specify which luggage types should have multiplied contents, including ancient statues.
* You can enable/disable spawn multiplier for bushes, ground-spawned items like mushrooms and vines.

## Installation

Either automatic via thunderstore, or unpack the .dll file into BepInEx/plugins.

## Configuration

* Launch the mod once.
* Edit the file BepInEx/config/com.github.Wesmania.ItemMultiplierBis.cfg.

## TODOs

* Verify if ground/bush/vine spawns are multiplied properly.
